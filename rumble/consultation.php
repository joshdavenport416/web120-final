            <h2>OPTION #1: THE RUMBLE (CONSULTATION)</h2>
            
            <p>At $200 the consultation is key. In this 2 hour time period I will learn about you and your family, what the functionality of the room needs to be for you, your involvement in the re-style and your budget. I want to know everything, where do you drink your coffee/wine? Are you right handed or left handed? Are the pets allowed on the furniture? All these details are what make for a successful Re-Style. I will also want to know your involvement: Do you want to be there to help during the re-style or do you want to leave and come back to magic? Also, what is your budget for anything we might need? Or is there even a budget?</p>

            <p>All of this, and more,  will be discussed during the 2 hours. When I leave, you will have a To-Do list and we will book the day for the Re-style. Typically one room takes 6-8 hours depending on the size of the room and details that need to go into it. For some this may be all you need, go forth and DIY.</p>

            <h2>OPTION #2: RE-STYLE (COLLABORATE)</h2>
            <p>After your consultation, we meet up within 2 weeks of the consult date. You had homework and now I'm back to get started with the Re-style. I'm 100% in charge. Let's Rumble.</p>

            <p>We take out everything in the room except the large furniture. Then we "shop" the house for any other items we might need to include. As my assistant,  we'll continually communicate about how you are feeling about the vibe of the room as we move and change everything.  In the end, you are left with a thoughtful, comfortable space that speaks to the needs of you and your family.  Collaboration is key, so get ready to be open, honest, and innovative as we begin this journey together.</p>

            <h2>OPTION #3: RE-STYLE (TRUST)</h2>
            <p>Don't have the time to hang around?  Want to be surprised by your new look?  This option allows me to take over 100% while you go about your daily life, and leave all the stress and worry to me.  I will transform your space with minimal or no supervision from you at all.  This option requires you to put more trust in me and my abilities; but, it also still gives you the input up front to let me know what you are looking for.  This option is a little more costly  because I will need to enlist help with moving things around your space and it takes longer.  This is the perfect option for the busy professional, career students, or someone who is simply too busy.  Collaboration is still key in this option as well, so I will take your thoughts and bring them to life as I re-think, re-style, and re-imagine a new space that will fit your life perfectly.</p>
